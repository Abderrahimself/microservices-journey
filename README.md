Microservices Journey
=====================

A comprehensive microservices architecture implementation using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, demonstrating modern distributed system patterns and best practices.

🏗️ Architecture Overview
-------------------------

This project implements a microservices ecosystem with the following components:

### Core Business Services

*   **Accounts Service** - Manages customer account information

*   **Cards Service** - Handles credit/debit card operations

*   **Loans Service** - Manages loan applications and processing


### Infrastructure Services

*   **Config Server** - Centralized configuration management using Spring Cloud Config

*   **Eureka Server** - Service discovery and registration

*   **Gateway Server** - API Gateway with routing, filtering, and cross-cutting concerns


🛠️ Technology Stack
--------------------

*   **Framework**: Spring Boot

*   **Microservices**: Spring Cloud

*   **Service Discovery**: Netflix Eureka

*   **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway

*   **Configuration**: Spring Cloud Config

*   **Build Tool**: Maven

*   **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose

🚀 Getting Started
------------------

### Prerequisites

*   Java 11 or higher

*   Maven 3.6+

*   Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for containerized deployment)


🌐 Service Endpoints
--------------------

Once all services are running, you can access:

*   **Eureka Dashboard**: http://localhost:8761

*   **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8072

*   **Config Server**: http://localhost:8071

*   **Accounts Service**: http://localhost:8080 (or via Gateway)

*   **Cards Service**: http://localhost:9000 (or via Gateway)

*   **Loans Service**: http://localhost:8090 (or via Gateway)



🔧 Key Features
---------------

### Configuration Management

*   Externalized configuration using Spring Cloud Config

*   Environment-specific configurations (default, qa, prod)

*   Real-time configuration refresh capabilities


### Service Discovery

*   Automatic service registration with Eureka

*   Client-side load balancing

*   Health check monitoring


### API Gateway

*   Single entry point for all client requests

*   Request routing and filtering

*   Cross-cutting concerns (authentication, logging, rate limiting)


### Resilience Patterns

*   Circuit breaker implementation

*   Retry mechanisms

*   Bulkhead isolation


🐳 Docker Support
-----------------

The project includes Docker Compose configurations for different environments:

*   **Default**: Basic setup for local development

*   **QA**: Quality assurance environment with monitoring

*   **Prod**: Production-ready setup with security and performance optimizations


📊 Monitoring & Observability
-----------------------------

The architecture supports comprehensive monitoring through:

*   Service health endpoints

*   Distributed tracing capabilities

*   Centralized logging

*   Metrics collection


🔒 Security Considerations
--------------------------

*   Gateway-level security implementation

*   Inter-service communication security

*   Configuration encryption support

*   Audit trail functionality
